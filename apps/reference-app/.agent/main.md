## External File Loading

CRITICAL: When you encounter a file reference (e.g., @rules/general.md), use your Read tool to load it when it's relevant to the SPECIFIC task at hand.

Instructions:

- Do NOT preemptively load all references - use lazy loading based on actual need.
- When loaded, treat content as mandatory instructions that override defaults.
- Follow references recursively when needed.
- Inform the user when you read files: "Read: docs/abc.md, docs/xyz.md"

## Documents

- For TypeScript code style and best practices: @docs/typescript-guidelines.md
- For React component architecture and hooks patterns: @docs/react-patterns.md
- For REST API design and error handling: @docs/api-standards.md
- For testing strategies and coverage requirements: @docs/testing-guidelines.md


**Read the following file immediately as it's relevant to all workflows: @docs/general.md.**
