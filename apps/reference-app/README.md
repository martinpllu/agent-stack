### Installation

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
pnpm install
```

### Development

1. Start SST in development mode (in a separate terminal):
```bash
npx sst dev
```

2. The app will be available at the URL shown in the SST output.

## Deployment

Deploy to AWS with SST:

```bash
npx sst deploy --stage production
```

## Contributing

This is a reference implementation demonstrating best practices for building full-stack applications with the agent-stack patterns.

## Database Architecture

### Aurora Serverless Setup

The application uses AWS Aurora Serverless v2 with PostgreSQL:

- **Production stage**: Has its own dedicated Aurora cluster
- **Creator stages** (`dev`, `staging`): Can create the shared development Aurora cluster
- **All other stages** (e.g., `feature123`, `bob`, `myenv`): Reference the shared dev cluster
- **Scale to zero**: Configured to pause after inactivity (10 minutes for dev, 60 minutes for prod)
- **Database separation**: Each stage creates and uses its own database within the cluster

### Configuration

- **Min capacity**: 0 ACU (scales to zero)
- **Max capacity**: 4 ACU for dev, 16 ACU for production
- **Auto-pause**: 10 minutes for dev, 60 minutes for production
- **PostgreSQL version**: 16.4

## Development

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- pnpm
- AWS account with SST configured
- (Optional) Docker for local PostgreSQL

### Setup

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
pnpm install
```

### Running Locally

#### Option 1: With Aurora Serverless (Recommended)

Deploy to your dev stage:
```bash
npx sst dev
```

This will:
- Create a VPC and Aurora cluster if they don't exist
- Set up your database with the stage name as the database/schema
- Start the development server with hot reloading

#### Option 2: With Local PostgreSQL

If you want to run with a local PostgreSQL database:

1. Start PostgreSQL locally:
```bash
docker run \
  --rm \
  -p 5432:5432 \
  -v $(pwd)/.sst/storage/postgres:/var/lib/postgresql/data \
  -e POSTGRES_USER=postgres \
  -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=password \
  -e POSTGRES_DB=local \
  postgres:16.4
```

2. Set the DATABASE_URL environment variable:
```bash
export DATABASE_URL="postgresql://postgres:password@localhost:5432/local"
```

3. Run the development server:
```bash
pnpm dev
```

### Database Migrations

1. Generate migrations:
```bash
pnpm drizzle-kit generate
```

2. Apply migrations:
```bash
pnpm drizzle-kit migrate
```

Or push changes directly (for development):
```bash
pnpm drizzle-kit push
```

## Deployment

### Deploy to production:
```bash
npx sst deploy --stage production
```

### Deploy to a personal dev stage:
```bash
npx sst deploy --stage your-name
```

Personal dev stages will share the dev Aurora cluster but use their own database.

**Important**: Before deploying a personal stage, ensure one of the creator stages (`dev` or `staging`) has been deployed to create the shared Aurora cluster:
```bash
# Deploy dev stage first to create the shared cluster
npx sst deploy --stage dev

# OR deploy staging stage
npx sst deploy --stage staging

# Then you can deploy personal stages
npx sst deploy --stage bob
npx sst deploy --stage feature123
```

## Architecture Notes

- The app automatically detects if it's running with Aurora Data API based on environment variables
- When using Aurora Data API, no persistent connections are needed
- The VPC is configured with managed NAT for Lambda functions
- Aurora clusters are retained in production, removed in other stages
- Each stage automatically creates its own database within the cluster on first connection
- The shared dev cluster uses a fixed identifier to enable cross-stage references

## Cost Optimization

- Aurora Serverless v2 scales to 0 ACU when not in use
- Auto-pause is configured to minimize costs during inactivity
- Dev stages share infrastructure to reduce costs
- Production has dedicated resources for isolation and performance

## Troubleshooting

### Database Connection Issues

If you're having trouble connecting to Aurora:

1. Check that the VPC and Aurora cluster are properly created:
```bash
npx sst dev --verbose
```

2. Verify the database credentials are being passed correctly by checking the SST outputs

3. For local development, ensure your PostgreSQL container is running and accessible

### Scale-to-Zero Resume Time

When Aurora is paused (scaled to zero), it takes about 15 seconds to resume on the first connection. This is normal behavior and helps reduce costs during periods of inactivity.
