# `agent-dx`

**Give AI agents a great developer experience!**

`agent-dx` helps you set up your application for development with AI agents.

After going through the setup process, your agents will have:

- **Orientation guide** A compact, comprehensive overview of your application's architecture and code layout, the available development tools, and pointers to more specific documentation.
- **Agent-friendly tools** Tools that give your agent 'eyes' and 'hands' to work with your development environment: start servers, access logs, query databases, set up and tear down test data, interactively debug the app...
- **Agent Journal** A simple MCP server that agents use to add key milestones, observations and problems to a Markdown journal.
- **Continuous improvement** A prompt that reads the journal and suggests changes to evolve your app, documentation and tools.
